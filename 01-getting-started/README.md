# 🐍 Python for Everybody - Coursera

Welcome to my **Python for Everybody** coursework repository from **University of Michigan** on Coursera!  
This repo contains assignments, practice problems, and notes for **Course 1: Getting Started with Python**.

## 🎯 Course 1 Overview

**Course 1: Getting Started with Python** focuses on the fundamentals of programming with Python, emphasizing **control flow** and basic computational thinking.  

## 📚 Chapter Overview

### Chapter 1: Why We Program?
- **Programming Overview**: Programs are sequences of instructions; computers follow them exactly.  
- **Role of the Programmer**: Bridge between hardware and users; imagine user needs and build reliable software.  
- **Precision & Errors**: Computers require perfect accuracy; a single syntax or logic error causes failure.  
- **Key Takeaways**: Programming builds tools, automates tasks, teaches logical thinking, and shifts perspective from using to creating technology.

### Chapter 2: Variables and Expressions
- **Constants & Variables**: Store data in memory; assignment (`=`) updates variables.  
- **Reserved Words**: Keywords like `if`, `for`, `return` cannot be used as variable names.  
- **Numerical Expressions & Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**` with proper order of operations.  
- **Variable Types**: `int`, `float`, `str`; Python enforces type rules and conversion functions (`int()`, `float()`, `str()`).  
- **Input & Comments**: Use `input()` for user input and `#` for comments.

### Chapter 3: Conditional Code
- **if Statements**: Run code only if conditions are true.  
- **elif & else**: Handle multi-way decisions; only one block runs.  
- **try & except**: Graceful error handling without crashing programs.

### Chapter 4: Functions
- **Defining Functions**: Use `def`; indentation matters.  
- **Parameters & Arguments**: Positional vs keyword arguments.  
- **Return Statement**: Returns a value to the caller and exits the function.  
- **Key Takeaway**: Functions store reusable code, reduce repetition, and improve readability.

### Chapter 5: Loops and Iteration
- **while Loops**: Indefinite loops; repeat while a condition is true.  
- **for Loops**: Definite loops; iterate over a sequence.  
- **Loop Control**: `break` exits loops, `continue` skips an iteration.  
- **Avoid Infinite Loops**: Ensure a condition eventually becomes false.

This course lays the foundation for **data structures, algorithms, and more advanced Python programming** in subsequent courses.
